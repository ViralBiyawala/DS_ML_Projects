# Dr.Semmelweis and the Discovery of Handwashing

## Project Overview
> This project focuses on analyzing historical data to explore the relationship between handwashing and childbed fever. The goal is to understand the impact of handwashing on reducing mortality rates among women giving birth. By examining the data, we aim to highlight the importance of handwashing in healthcare settings and its potential to save lives.

## Implementation
> The project implementation can be found in the `notebook.ipynb` file. This Jupyter Notebook contains the code and analysis steps required to explore the data, visualize trends, and draw insights about the effect of handwashing on reducing childbed fever mortality rates.

## Data
> The project utilizes two datasets located in the `datasets` folder:
> - `yearly_deaths_by_clinic.csv`: This dataset provides information on the yearly number of births and deaths at two clinics from 1841 to 1846.
> - `monthly_deaths.csv`: This dataset includes monthly data on births and deaths at Clinic 1, allowing us to observe the impact of handwashing over time.

## Getting Started
> To get started with this project, follow these steps:
> 
> 1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
> 2. Open the `notebook.ipynb` file using Jupyter Notebook or any compatible environment.
> 3. Run the cells in the notebook to execute the code and reproduce the analysis.
> 4. Explore the results, examine visualizations, and gain insights into the relationship between handwashing and childbed fever.

## Dependencies
