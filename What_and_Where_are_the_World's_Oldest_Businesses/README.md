# Project Overview

This project aims to analyze the oldest businesses in the world using a dataset compiled by BusinessFinancing.co.uk. The dataset contains information about the oldest businesses in various countries, including their names, year founded, category code, and country code. The analysis explores factors that enable businesses to stand the test of time and also examines the distribution of oldest businesses across continents and industries.

## Implementation

The project is implemented using Python and the pandas library for data manipulation and analysis. The dataset is loaded into pandas DataFrames, and various operations such as sorting, merging, grouping, and filtering are performed to extract insights from the data. The results are then displayed or stored for further analysis.
