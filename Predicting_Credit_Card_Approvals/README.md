# Predicting Credit Card Approvals

## Project Overview
> This project focuses on predicting credit card approvals using machine learning techniques. The goal is to develop a model that can accurately assess credit card applications and predict their approval status. By automating this process, it can help financial institutions streamline their approval process, minimize risks, and improve overall efficiency.

## Implementation
> The project implementation can be found in the `notebook.ipynb` file. This Jupyter Notebook contains the code, data exploration, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation steps necessary to build the credit card approval predictor.

## Data
> All the data files required for this project are located in the `datasets` folder. The dataset includes information such as applicant demographics, financial attributes, and previous credit history. The data is used to train and evaluate the credit card approval prediction model.

## Getting Started
> To get started with this project, follow these steps:
> 
> 1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
> 2. Open the `notebook.ipynb` file using Jupyter Notebook or any compatible environment.
> 3. Run the cells in the notebook to execute the code and reproduce the analysis.
> 4. Explore the results, experiment with different techniques, and make improvements as needed.
