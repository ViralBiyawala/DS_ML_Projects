# The Visual History of Nobel Price Winners
 
 ## Project Overview
 > This project analyzes the Nobel Prize dataset from 1901 to 2016 to explore various aspects of the prize, such as the representation of different genders and countries, the dominance of the United States, the age of winners, and the presence of repeat laureates. The dataset provides information about the Nobel laureates, including their birth country, sex, category of the prize, and birth date.
 
 ## Implementation
 > The project implementation can be found in the `notebook.ipynb` file. This Jupyter Notebook contains the code, data exploration, feature engineering, Data Visulization, and evaluation steps necessary to show the distribution of the Nobel Prize with various measures from 1901 to 2016.
 
 ## Data
 > The project utilizes the `nobel.csv` dataset located in the `datasets` folder. This dataset contains information about Nobel laureates, including their names, birth country, sex, birth date, prize category, and year of the prize.
